            <p className='text-[#8493A8] mb-3'>The priorities are different for each website depending on what businesses they are going to represent. There are billions of websites in the modern time helping people by providing required services. If a person wants to download something, he simply goes to browsers and searches for it. And hundreds of websites pop up, giving the best results for that particular search.</p>
            <p className='text-[#8493A8]'>This procedure looks from this point of view, but it is very complex. A developer has to spend weeks to months coming up with a successfully developed website. There are various things that need to be done. Hence, platforms like Bootstrap and Tailwind are very significant for developers and designers.</p>
